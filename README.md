## Stakeholder Needs Analysis

A stakeholder needs analysis (SNA) was employed in order to identify insight needs and use cases for using indicators and visualizations of emergence (and indirectly convergence) in daily decision making environments. Specifically, the SNA was designed to identify stakeholder demographics, task types, insight needs, work contexts, and priorities to better understand how decision makers might utilize static and dynamic information visualizations, topics of concern, and metrics currently used when making decisions.
