## Stakeholder Needs Analysis and User Study

A stakeholder needs analysis (SNA) was employed in order to identify insight needs and use cases for using indicators and visualizations of emergence (and indirectly convergence) in daily decision making environments. Specifically, the SNA was designed to identify stakeholder demographics, task types, insight needs, work contexts, and priorities to better understand how decision makers might utilize static and dynamic information visualizations, topics of concern, and metrics currently used when making decisions.

User study was employed to

## Data Provenance

``Web of Science``

## Keyword Extraction - MaxMatch

Using results from a linguistic algorithm comparison detailed in Börner et al. (2018), the MaxMatch algorithm was used to identify terms in NSF funding awards that match the unique WOS Author Keywords specific to the three topic areas. Characters like [ ] { } and” were removed.   

## Network Layout Algorithms

Gephi (Version 0.9.2) (Bastian, Heymann, & Jacomy, 2009) was used to compute data overlays with the following plugins:

-	*ForceAtlas2* was used to layout the Co-Author Network figure
-	*GeoLayout* was used to create 1) the Co-Author network overlaid on US map with mercator basemap and the Temporal Convergence figure using x-y coordinates to display nodes

## Burst Detection

Burst Detection uses Kleinberg's algorithm available in Sci2 (Sci2 Team, 2009). See top 10 keywords for each domain

## Top Organization and Funding

WOS portal was used to extract the top funding agencies and research institutions in three domains.
